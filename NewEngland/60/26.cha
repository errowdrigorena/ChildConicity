*PAR2:	and they have to go driving in cars too . 3140515_3142335
*PAR2:	then they have big tunnels . 3143365_3145135
*PAR2:	and they have subways that goes underneath the traffic . 3147045_3150185
*PAR2:	then . 3151215_3151505
*PAR2:	and sometimes they have to go really deep way [/] way under the ground . 3153445_3157545

*PAR2:	workers need to use take very far down . 3164095_3168985
*PAR2:	and then they got for those tunnels and then connect them . 3169085_3173465
*PAR2:	then the workers have to be ex make a little tube and have to be extra careful . 3175495_3183835
*PAR2:	so the tubes don't cave in . 3184135_3186515
*PAR2:	okay . 3187185_3187475
*PAR1:	that means is you see how the tube is round . 3188105_3191395
*PAR1:	yeah . 3191505_3191795
*PAR1:	and then they have to scaffolding . 3191815_3193195
