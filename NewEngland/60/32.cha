*PAR3:	get back home when everybody drives a car they're terrible traffic jams . 2485245_2491145

*PAR3:	the trains carry people under the buildings and under the traffic . 2503345_2508245
*PAR3:	some subway tunnels aren't very deep . 2512885_2515455
*PAR3:	but other tunnels have to go way down under all the buildings . 2516645_2521945
*PAR3:	the rivers and even other subways to make deep tunnels . 2522605_2529775
*PAR3:	builders take big holes called shafts straight down into the ground . 2530575_2536335
*PAR3:	and then connect them . 2537165_2538145
*PAR3:	they have to take all the muck the dirt and the rocks out of the hole in big buckets . 2539325_2545415

*PAR3:	sometimes they work inside a big steel tube called a shield . 2554815_2559025
*PAR3:	it protects them from falling dirt and rocks . 2560265_2563565
*PAR3:	as they work the builders make the floors and the walls of the tunnel . 2566775_2570835
*PAR3:	they put down the tracks for the train . 2571785_2573715
*PAR3:	they also have to put in wires for lights so the drivers can see under the ground . 2574885_2579735
*PAR3:	when the tunnels are done workers use the holes to build air supplies ticket offices and elevators for people to ride up and down . 2584155_2595295
*PAR3:	what's they're built . 2599265_2600125
