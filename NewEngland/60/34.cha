*PAR0:	okay . 2292465_2292755
*PAR0:	now Rachel started to tell me a little bit about the new house being built in New Hampshire and going canoeing and seeing the loons . 2293215_2299635
*PAR0:	mhm . 2299695_2300115
*PAR0:	but is there anything else that was also exciting that you can talk about that happened this summer . 2300415_2304595
*PAR0:	or you can talk more about that . 2305415_2306395
*PAR0:	if you can't think of anything else . 2306455_2307715
*PAR0:	the next day we saw the three loads together . 2308735_2312715
*PAR0:	you did . 2313695_2314155
*PAR3:	did . 2315825_2316045
*PAR3:	so . 2316045_2316205
*PAR3:	we knew that the parents had finally found . 2316205_2317605
*PAR4:	the baby found the baby <who had> [/] who had gotten away accidentally . 2317605_2320365
*PAR4:	mhm . 2320365_2320765
*PAR3:	well let's see . 2322865_2323555
*PAR3:	you [/] you talked about the house and &-um talked about the alpine slide . 2323775_2329265
*PAR0:	and went to the alpine slide . 2330885_2334385
*PAR4:	you did . 2335005_2335385
*PAR4:	so . 2335485_2335705
*PAR4:	I . 2336025_2336145
*PAR3:	might not know when the alpine slide is . 2336145_2337585
*PAR3:	yeah . 2337775_2338065
*PAR0:	well it's where there's chair lifts . 2339055_2342185
*PAR0:	and you go up the chair lifts . 2342645_2344505
*PAR0:	and there's sleds being hooked on the chair lifts . 2344925_2348265
*PAR0:	and then when you're up you get off and go to your left and go to two slides . 2348605_2358245
*PAR0:	<and you and> [/] you and there and there's this thing that's on the &-um sled . 2358985_2369365
*PAR0:	yeah . 2369675_2369965
*PAR0:	and when you pull it forward it breaks . 2369965_2372485
*PAR0:	and so before you go down you have to check your brake . 2373225_2377045
*PAR0:	and you can go down fast slow . 2377625_2380125
*PAR0:	but when there's a sign that says slow you slow down . 2380745_2385705
*PAR0:	and when there's a hill you really slow down . 2386005_2388225
*PAR0:	uhhuh . 2388395_2388745
*PAR0:	and once I know someone that didn't slow down . 2389365_2393745
*PAR0:	and so when he went down the steep hill he had his daughter with him and broke his daughter his ankle . 2394525_2403695
*PAR3:	she probably fell out of the sled . 2404735_2406035
*PAR3:	because he could it's [/] it's in a trough right a concrete trough . 2406595_2410035
*PAR3:	and if you go too fast you go right out of it . 2410335_2412835
*PAR4:	right . 2412965_2413315
*PAR4:	isn't mean like in the olympics . 2413315_2414995
*PAR4:	like the luge . 2415025_2415715
*PAR4:	kind of course . 2415865_2416435
*PAR4:	but it's not ice down right . 2416855_2418155
*PAR3:	no . 2418535_2418755
*PAR4:	oh boy . 2419495_2420075
*PAR4:	so I guess you just have to be careful huh . 2420135_2421715
*PAR0:	yeah . 2422105_2422395
*PAR0:	and Jessica went very fast . 2423275_2425255
*PAR0:	and when I went down with her she went as fast as she could . 2425635_2431175
*PAR0:	and I wanted to go faster . 2431595_2433055
*PAR4:	oh yeah . 2433675_2434095
*PAR4:	I'm pretty courageous of you . 2434275_2435575
*PAR3:	every summer Rachel has wanted to go faster down the alternate slide . 2436665_2439735
*PAR3:	she's been on it every summer of her life . 2440025_2441695
*PAR3:	the first time when she was seven months old . 2441995_2443535
*PAR3:	oh always with an adult . 2443795_2444935
*PAR3:	she hasn't gone by herself yet . 2445115_2446615
*PAR3:	but she seems to like going down faster than . 2447835_2449935
*PAR3:	I don't think I'd go fast enough for her anymore . 2450375_2452215
*PAR4:	that's [/] that's exciting . 2454565_2455705
*PAR4:	anything else . 2456185_2456385
*PAR4:	especially that you did . 2456385_2457305
*PAR3:	no . 2458245_2458465
*PAR3:	talk about the frogs . 2458815_2459825
*PAR3:	this one's the highlights of the summer . 2460135_2461345
*PAR0:	yeah . 2461775_2462065
*PAR0:	we [/] we there's a pond near where we live that have a lot of frogs . 2462065_2470305
*PAR0:	and some of them are pretty big . 2470805_2473345
*PAR0:	and there's a kid named healing that doesn't treat frogs . 2474405_2480655
*PAR0:	very good . 2480805_2481335
*PAR0:	she catches them with her hand and squeeze . 2481755_2485055
*PAR0:	he says . 2485075_2485495
*PAR4:	oh no . 2486795_2487335
*PAR3:	but what do you always what do people always do pretty soon after they catch the frogs . 2490235_2493700
*PAR0:	let them go . 2494025_2494605
*PAR0:	yeah . 2494715_2495005
*PAR4:	it's a good thing to do . 2495115_2496125
*PAR4:	how big when you say . 2498085_2498945
*PAR4:	can you show with your hands . 2498945_2499785
*PAR4:	how big the biggest ones you've seen get . 2499805_2501545
*PAR0:	biggest last year I saw some pretty big frogs like about that big . 2501575_2507505
*PAR4:	it's pretty big . 2507895_2508625
*PAR3:	when we go to the frog pond we have to keep the dog in the house because the dog will scare all the frogs away . 2510655_2515305
*PAR0:	or keep her in one part of the frog alive . 2515525_2518265
*PAR3:	she doesn't quite know what to do with the frogs . 2518445_2520425
*PAR3:	right . 2520635_2520985
*PAR3:	but she [/] she does scare them when they jump into . 2521325_2523145
*PAR0:	the water <I bet> [/] I bet . 2523205_2524265
*PAR0:	&-um she uses for jaws . 2524325_2527145
*PAR3:	you think she'd fight one or . 2527445_2528985
*PAR0:	she caught it . 2528985_2529385
*PAR0:	I bet she would eat . 2530105_2531105
*PAR3:	it you think she'd eat it all up . 2531105_2532425
*PAR4:	no I don't think dogs eat dogs . 2532805_2534505
*PAR4:	I don't know though . 2534945_2535425
*PAR4:	yeah . 2535425_2535665
*PAR3:	she I had a dog who ate a turtle . 2535665_2536905
*PAR3:	once I had a little pet turtle . 2536975_2538945
*PAR3:	and my dog ate it . 2538945_2539705
*PAR4:	I was so sad . 2539825_2540305
*PAR3:	yeah it was . 2540825_2541425
*PAR4:	was about . 2541805_2542145
*PAR4:	I'm surprised . 2542205_2542585
*PAR4:	kids surprised . 2542585_2543265
*PAR4:	I didn't think . 2543265_2543705
*PAR0:	at least killer . 2545325_2546425
*PAR3:	yeah . 2546855_2547145
*PAR3:	luckily she's never actually caught one . 2547575_2549385
*PAR3:	right . 2549435_2549785
*PAR3:	she's been pretty close though . 2550035_2551265
*PAR0:	yeah . 2551855_2552145
*PAR4:	and you also see little tadpoles in the pond . 2552405_2554545
*PAR4:	yeah . 2554735_2555025
*PAR4:	oh the babies . 2555285_2555865
*PAR0:	yeah . 2556785_2557075
*PAR0:	a water of babies . 2557795_2558595
*PAR0:	and once we saw nests . 2559135_2561195
*PAR3:	the clumps of frog eggs . 2561855_2563075
*PAR3:	yeah . 2563225_2563515
*PAR3:	yeah . 2563545_2563835
*PAR3:	we had gone up &-um fairly early in the spring the day they poured the foundation . 2563895_2567395
*PAR3:	and we walked around in the pod . 2568095_2569355
*PAR3:	and there were big clumps of frog eggs . 2569435_2571155
*PAR3:	we probably saw some of those Ted poles this summer . 2572485_2575585
*PAR3:	same ones that we had seen as eggs . 2576375_2577785
*PAR0:	yeah . 2578575_2578865
*PAR0:	but we didn't actually see the frog . 2579045_2581145
*PAR0:	we just saw the eggs . 2581805_2582865
*PAR3:	yeah . 2582935_2583225
*PAR3:	because it was too early for the frogs to be out . 2583225_2584745
*PAR0:	it would be neat to watch a frog get out of the bag . 2586865_2589805
*PAR3:	yeah I don't know . 2590275_2590965
*PAR3:	it must be pretty small at that point . 2591025_2592565
*PAR3:	yeah . 2593195_2593485
*PAR3:	maybe we'll be there someday day when that happens . 2593775_2595445
*PAR0:	do you have any idea . 2596575_2597355
*PAR3:	how big frogs are when they hatch . 2597355_2598715
*PAR4:	well [/] well I mean will they emerge from eggs exist tadpoles . 2599785_2602795
*PAR4:	right . 2602795_2602995
*PAR3:	but how big is the ta . 2602995_2603675
*PAR3:	would you be able to see it . 2603675_2604395
*PAR4:	yeah . 2604745_2605035
*PAR4:	they're tiny . 2605035_2605715
*PAR4:	mhm . 2606055_2606475
*PAR4:	you know because they [/] they get much larger as tadpoles before they start to sprout their limbs . 2606695_2610675
*PAR4:	mhm . 2610775_2611195
*PAR4:	yeah . 2611545_2611835
*PAR4:	you'd be able to see it but you have to get very down . 2611835_2614475
*PAR3:	close . 2614475_2614715
*PAR3:	and yeah . 2614715_2615275
*PAR3:	we have to be there on the right day . 2615275_2616515

*PAR3:	it's not fair . 2695315_2695885
*PAR3:	when you finally get old enough to make those decisions and be allowed to stay up late . 2695885_2699445
